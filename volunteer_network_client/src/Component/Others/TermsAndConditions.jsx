          1. Introduction and Services: By using any of the Ancestry websites,
          services, and mobile apps that link to these terms—Ancestry®,
          AncestryDNA®, Newspapers.com™, Find a Grave®, Fold3®, Archives®, and
          WeRemember®—as well as other related brands (the “Services"), you
          agree to these Terms and Conditions (the “Terms”). Any new features
          included in the Services in the future will also be subject to these
          Terms. Please be aware that these Terms incorporate by reference
          additional policies and guidelines, including the Community Rules,
          Cookie Policy, Copyright Policy, Renewal and Cancellation Terms, as
          well as our Privacy Statement, which explains how we collect and use
          your personal data. We encourage you to read all of these documents
          carefully to understand your rights and responsibilities when using
          the Services. Additional terms may apply when you sign up for a new
          Service or take advantage of a new promotion or special offer. These
          terms will be disclosed to you and become part of your agreement with
          us if you use those Services, promotions, or offers. If any additional
          terms conflict with these Terms, those additional terms will prevail.
          If you have any questions about these Terms or our Services, please
          contact us. 1.1 Unexpected Results. When using our Services you may
          discover unexpected facts about yourself or your family in public
          records, Ancestry Content, DNA results, or another User’s content. You
          acknowledge that such discoveries may have a strong emotional impact
          on you and others with whom you share these discoveries. You expressly
          agree to assume all risks associated with your use of the Services,
          and that Ancestry shall not be liable for any social, emotional, or
          legal consequences of such discoveries. 1.2 Eligibility to Use the
          Services. Everyone who uses the Services, whether an unregistered
          guest, free registered guest, paid subscriber, or a purchaser or
          activator of a DNA kit, is a “User.” Users may need to create an
          account to use certain Services. Users must provide accurate,
          complete, and current information when registering. The Services are
          intended for those who have reached the age of consent where they are
          being offered. If you are between the ages of 13 and the age of
          consent where you reside, you may use the Services (excluding any
          Services requiring a DNA test) with your parent's or guardian's
          permission. Children under the age of 13 are not permitted to create
          accounts, however, they are allowed to use AncestryClassroom™ through
          their school and with their parent’s or guardian’s permission. 1.3 Use
          of the Services. In exchange for access to the Services, you agree: To
          comply with Ancestry’s Community Rules, Cookie Policy, Copyright
          Policy, and Renewal and Cancellation Terms; To comply with all
          applicable laws; To be responsible for all use and activity of the
          Services associated with your account or log-in information; To
          contact us if you suspect your account has been used without your
          authorization or you believe your username and password have been
          stolen; Not to resell the Services or resell, reproduce, or publish
          any content or information found on the Services, except as explicitly
          described in these Terms; Not to circumvent, disable or otherwise
          interfere with security-related features of the Services; and Not to
          access or collect data in bulk or using automated means, or attempt to
          access data without permission. This includes, but is not limited to,
          any bots, crawlers, spiders, data-miners, or scrapers. 1.4 Additional
          Terms Applicable to Use of DNA Services. The purpose of the DNA
          Services is to provide genetic and genealogy results and related
          reports for your informational, recreational, educational and research
          use. As used in these Terms, “DNA Services” refers to the use of our
          AncestryDNA test kit, processing and handling of your DNA sample,
          genetic testing of your DNA sample, and our web or mobile app-based
          tools that provide you with ethnicity and other genetically-related
          results and associated services. 1.4.1 Eligibility to Use DNA
          Services. You must be at least 18 years old to purchase or activate a
          DNA test kit. To help us ensure the integrity and quality of our
          database and protect your privacy, each adult who submits a saliva
          sample for a DNA test must create their own account and activate their
          own test. DNA test activators must also explicitly consent to the
          processing of sensitive personal information. A parent or legal
          guardian may activate a DNA test, provide us Personal Information, and
          send us the saliva sample of their own minor child for processing
          using their account. By activating a DNA test for, or submitting any
          Personal Information about, a minor you represent that you are the
          minor’s parent or legal guardian. You also agree that you have
          discussed the DNA test with the minor and the minor has agreed to the
          collection and processing of their saliva. 1.4.2 Your Use of DNA
          Services. In addition to the requirements in Section 1.3 above, you
          also agree: Not to resell DNA test kits; Any saliva sample you provide
          is either your own or the saliva of a person for whom you are a parent
          or legal guardian; Not to send us a sample in violation of any export
          ban or other law; By providing a saliva sample to us, you acquire no
          rights in any research or commercial products developed by us or our
          collaborators/partners and will receive no compensation related to any
          such research or product development; and Not to use the information
          obtained from the DNA Services (including any downloaded DNA Data
          (defined in the Privacy Statement)) in whole, in part, and/or in
          combination with any other database, for any medical, diagnostic, or
          paternity testing purpose, in any judicial proceeding, or for any
          discriminatory purpose or illegal activity.
          <br />
          1.4.3 Ancestry’s Provision of DNA Services. You agree that in order to
          facilitate your use of DNA Services, we may directly or through other
          companies who help us provide DNA Services: Provide your saliva sample
          and DNA to other companies that help us provide the Services, such as
          our laboratory partners; Extract your DNA from your saliva; Perform
          genetic tests in the United States (or, in the future, in other
          countries) on the resulting DNA using test methods available now or
          developed; Compare your DNA results with other DNA Data in the
          Ancestry database to provide the Services, including matching you to
          others in our database with whom you share DNA (you are in control as
          to whether or not to see and be seen by your DNA matches); Disclose to
          you, and others that you authorize, the results of the tests
          performed; Store your DNA results;
          <br />
          Store your saliva and any extracted DNA in the United States or
          destroy any remaining saliva or DNA sample after your sample has been
          processed; once submitted to us, your saliva and DNA sample cannot be
          returned to you (note, however, that you may request that we destroy
          your sample, and, in certain cases we may destroy biological samples
          to maintain biobank quality levels); Allow certain of our laboratory
          partners to use a portion of activated or inactivated saliva samples
          to calibrate or validate instruments, equipment, or laboratory methods
          used in providing DNA Services; and Use your Genetic Information and
          other Personal Information as described in these Terms and the Privacy
          Statement.
          <br />
          1.4.4 Downloading your DNA Data. We protect your information as
          described in our Privacy Statement. If you choose to download a copy
          of your DNA Data, that copy is not protected by our security measures
          and you are solely responsible for storing, securing, and protecting
          that downloaded data. Ancestry has no responsibility if you elect to
          share or transfer your downloaded DNA Data with others, either
          intentionally or inadvertently. Your DNA Data is intended only for
          your personal use.
          <br />
          1.4.5 Note to Users who have received a bone marrow or stem cell
          transplant. If you have received a bone marrow or stem cell
          transplant, your AncestryDNA test may provide unexpected results
          because your saliva may contain cells with your DNA as well as cells
          with your donor’s DNA. DNA for the test is extracted from the cells,
          and the combination of DNA sources can result in a failed test or a
          test that provides results based on your donor’s DNA. Therefore, we
          recommend that those who have received a bone marrow or stem cell
          transplant do not take the AncestryDNA test. If you have already taken
          the test, please contact us for further assistance.
          <br />

          that does not allow us to broadly limit our liability, some of these
          limitations may not apply to you.
